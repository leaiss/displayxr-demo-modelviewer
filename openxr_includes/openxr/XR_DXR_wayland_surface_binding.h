 * @file
 * @brief  Header for XR_DXR_wayland_surface_binding extension
 * @author David Fattal
 * @ingroup external_openxr
 *
 * This extension lets an OpenXR application provide its own Wayland surface
 * (wl_display* + wl_surface*) to the runtime on desktop Linux. When provided,
 * the runtime renders into the application's surface instead of creating its
 * own window. Sibling of XR_DXR_xlib_window_binding (X11), XR_DXR_win32_window_binding
 * (HWND), and XR_DXR_cocoa_window_binding (NSView).
 *
 * The app owns the surface lifecycle (registry, xdg-shell toplevel, configure
 * acks, the Wayland event loop); the runtime only builds its VkSurfaceKHR from
 * the pair via VK_KHR_wayland_surface. Transparency is native on Wayland — a
 * surface composites its premultiplied alpha over whatever is behind it, so
 * transparentBackgroundEnabled needs no ARGB-visual dance (unlike X11).

// This was originally 1004999210, which COLLIDED with
// XR_TYPE_DISPLAY_DESKTOP_POSITION_DXR: the 210–219 decade already belonged to
// XR_DXR_display_info's v16+ additions (see this directory's README.md
// registry), not to the window-binding siblings. Both structs happened to be
// chained onto different parents, so nothing misbehaved in practice, but two
// distinct XrStructureType values must never share a number. Corrected to a
// fresh decade; the extension is at SPEC_VERSION 1 and no shipped app chains
// this struct, so the renumber breaks nothing.
